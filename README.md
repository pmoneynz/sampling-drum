- **Real-Time Recording**: Record performances with quantization
- **Waveform Editor**: Visual sample editing with trim controls
- **Mixer**: Individual volume and pan controls for each pad
- **Project Management**: Save/load projects using IndexedDB

### üéπ Pad Grid
- 16 velocity-sensitive pads mapped to keyboard keys (Q-R, A-F, Z-V, 1-4)
- Drag-and-drop sample loading
- Visual feedback during triggering
- Support for WAV, AIFF, and MP3 files

### üéõÔ∏è Sequencer
- Classic MPC-style 16-step grid
- Click to toggle steps on/off
- Real-time step indicator during playback
- Pattern management (create, duplicate, clear)

### üåä Waveform Editor
- Interactive waveform display using wavesurfer.js
- Trim controls (start/end points)
- Volume adjustment
- Sample information display
- Playback controls

### üéöÔ∏è Mixer
- Individual volume faders for each pad
- Pan controls (left/right positioning)
- Mute/Solo functionality
- Master volume control
- Global reset functions

### üíæ File Management
- Save projects to browser storage (IndexedDB)
- Load previously saved projects
- Export projects as JSON files
- Import projects from JSON files

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sampling-drum
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

## Usage

### Loading Samples
1. Navigate to the **PADS** view
2. Click on any pad or drag and drop audio files onto pads
3. Supported formats: WAV, AIFF, MP3

### Creating Patterns
1. Switch to the **SEQUENCER** view
2. Click on steps to toggle them on/off
3. Use the transport controls to play/stop/record

### Editing Samples
1. Select a pad with a loaded sample
2. Switch to the **WAVEFORM** view
3. Adjust trim points, volume, and other parameters

### Mixing
1. Switch to the **MIXER** view
2. Adjust volume and pan for each pad
3. Use mute/solo for quick mixing

### Saving Projects
1. Click the file manager button (bottom right)
2. Enter a project name and click "Save"
3. Projects are stored in your browser's local storage

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Pad Triggers
- **Q, W, E, R**: Pads 1-4
- **A, S, D, F**: Pads 5-8
- **Z, X, C, V**: Pads 9-12
- **1, 2, 3, 4**: Pads 13-16

### Transport
- **Spacebar**: Play/Pause (when implemented)

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **React 18**: UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better development experience
- **Tone.js**: Web Audio API wrapper for audio processing
- **Wavesurfer.js**: Waveform visualization and editing
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server

### Audio Engine
The `AudioEngine` class manages all audio functionality:
- Sample loading and playback
- Pattern sequencing
- Transport controls
- Project serialization

### Data Storage
- **IndexedDB**: Browser-based storage for projects
- **JSON Export/Import**: Cross-platform project sharing

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 66+
- Firefox 60+
